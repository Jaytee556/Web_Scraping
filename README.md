Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. A request is sent to the website and the website responds by sending the HTML code of the web page. Web scraping uses a website URL to access and extract data you need from the HTML code on that page. 

Web scraping allows you to quickly and efficiently gather information from websites, without having to do all the tedious copy-pasting yourself.
